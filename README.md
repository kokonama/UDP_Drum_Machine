This patch is intended to be used to test udp connection. 

Instructions:

1.Connect to local network.
2.Choose network interface (en0 by default).
3.Click "start".

If you're having trouble connecting to another computer, try the multicast button, which casts over IP 225.225.225.225.

Online/Offline use can be toggled with the respective switch.

This uses "shell", which can be downloaded here https://github.com/jeremybernstein/shell/releases/tag/1.0b2
